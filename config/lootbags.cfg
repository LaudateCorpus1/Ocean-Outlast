"blacklisted items" {
    # Adding a modid and internal item name to this list will remove the item from the general loot table.  The entry must be in the form <modid>:<itemname>:<damage> on a single line or it won't work right.  Example to blacklist iron ingots: minecraft:iron_ingot:0.  An entire modcan be blacklisted by just entering the modid and nothing else.
