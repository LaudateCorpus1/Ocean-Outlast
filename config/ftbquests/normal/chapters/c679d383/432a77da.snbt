		"The Agricarnation is a functional flower that will use mana to speed up crop growth. This flower uses mana to randomly apply a bonemeal effect to crops planted nearby, with a range of 5 blocks. It will continue to use mana to apply this effect even after crops are fully grown. It can be disabled at will by applying a redstone signal."
